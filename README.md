# Evanski's RaccoonMischief Minecraft Plugin
Formerly a Datapack

This is a Custom Minecraft plugin, that adds new features to vanilla minecraft
This is a companion project to [Mercerenies' A-Turtles-Troll](https://github.com/Mercerenies/a-turtles-troll). 
Neither directly depends on the other, but they are designed with each other in mind.

(Probably won't understand without the resourcepack as well)
