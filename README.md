# Evanski's RaccoonMischief Minecraft Plugin

This is an Minecraft plugin for Spigot, that adds new features to vanilla minecraft  
This is a companion project to [Mercerenies' A-Turtles-Troll](https://github.com/Mercerenies/a-turtles-troll).   
Neither directly depends on the other, but they are designed with each other in mind.

(Probably won't understand without the resourcepack,
