# Evanski's RaccoonMischief Minecraft DataPack

This is a Custom Minecraft datapack, that adds new features to vanilla minecraft
This is a companion project to [Mercerenies' A-Turtles-Troll](https://github.com/Mercerenies/a-turtles-troll). 
Neither directly depends on the other, but they are designed with each other in mind.

(Probably won't understand without the resourcepack as well)
*Might make the resourcepack public...maybe? Has a lot of "barrowed assets"

# Uses Resources from
[Custom Food Template Made by Timber Forge](https://youtu.be/TtdHB984DDc)

# How to install
Open your minecraft world save (%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft/saves/(world name))
drop the main "RaccoonMischief" folder (next to lists folder) into the folder named "datapacks" in your world save folder
open the world in MC, and do /reload
everything should work, enjoy
